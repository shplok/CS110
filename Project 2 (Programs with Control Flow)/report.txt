4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Wind Chill)
      Approach: I started off by looking at my code for the winchill problem from project 1. I had a feeling that the code would be pretty similar to the code that I wrote earlier. I ended up using the same variables and formula for calculation. Then I wrote the code to make sure that if the specified "t"value was greater than 50, there would be a output that would pop up that says that "t" must be less than 50. I then did the same thing for the value of v for being greater than 3. I then finished it by writing w - windchill in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues on this problem.

   Problem 2 (Day of the Week)
      Approach: I first accepted m d y as integer values symbolizing the month, day, and year. after that, I added the calculations to determine the day of the week, notated as dow. After that, I assigned each dow number to a day corresponding to the correct weekday name. Then, I wrote dow in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues on this problem.

   Problem 3 (Playing Card)
      Approach: first I determined a random number for rank and suit, rank being random from [2, 14] and suit being random from [1, 4]. Then, for the rank, I set rankStr equal to " " so that there was an empty space to work with. When picking a random number 2 - 14, the empty space is then filled with the character assinged to its respected number value. The same goes for suit. I then finally wrote rankStr of suitStr in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues on this problem.

   Problem 4 (Root Finding)
      Approach: I first started by assigning values to k, c, and, EPSILON, also making our guess (t) equal to c. I then added the formula for calculating the kth root of c up to epsilon decimal places and wrote that in standard output followed by a newline character.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues on this problem.

   Problem 5 (Greatest Common Divisor)
      Approach: I first started by accepting p and q as system arguments (int) and then w as a temporary value. I then used modulo to determine that if the remainder of p/q is not 0, then i switched the values and wrote the remainder of the new w/q and then wrote "q" in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues on this problem

   Problem 6 (Fibonacci Number)
      Approach: I began by accepting n as a command line input and then assigned values to a,b,c,and i. a and b both equal to 1 and c as the temporary value to switch. i then represents 3 for the fibonacci sequence. I then wrote the formula to determine the number for where i is less than or equal to n. I then wrote b in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues when attempting this problem.

   Problem 7 (Sum of Powers)
      Approach: I accepted n and k as system arguments and then set total equal to 0. After that I used the function, "for i in range(1, n+1): doing n + 1 since it isnt inclusive. I then wrote total += i**k and wrote total in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues when working on this problem.

   Problem 8 (Dragon Curve)
      Approach: I began by accepting n as an integer in a system argument. I then next set dragon and nogard equal to the string "F". I then set the store value equal to 0. I then used the for i in range function with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of n (n+1). I then switched the values and wrote dragon in standard output. 

      Issues and resolution: I had some trouble switching dragon and nogard and writing L and R as well. I then realized that I had the values switched around and then I was able to figure it out after moving them around a bit. 

   Problem 9 (Perfect Numbers)
      Approach: I first started by importing n as an integer in command-line input. Then for i in the range [2,n], I would check to see if the remainder of i/j was zero. If so, then the total is incimented by j until total is equal to i. after this is the case, total is written in standard output. 
      Issues and resolution: I think at first, I forgot to add the second = sign to if total == 0 and so i kept getting no output because there was no way it could be zero. After I did a little bit of digging, I was able to figure out what the issue was and solve it.

   Problem 10 (Ramanujan Numbers)
      Approach: First I accepted n as an int input and set a equal to 1. for the first while loop, if a^3 is less than or euqal to n, then b = a+1 and so on and so forth, following the same rule for each variable given the formulas. After following all of the formulas, then I checked if x == y, x being the formula for a^3 + b^
and y being the formula c^3 + d^3

If this equation is true, then the variables are written in standard output.

      Issues and resolution: I don't even know where to start, I had so much trouble with the nested while loops and trying to get all the values to equal what they needed to. I also had a bit of trouble with getting the strings of the numbers to write correctly for gradescope. After a lot of trial and error, around 2 hours of such, I was able to get the program to do what I wanted it to.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was fun but Ramanujan numbers made my hair fall out

Thank you!
