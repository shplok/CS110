4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (RSA Library)
      Approach: 
I began by reading through the API and determining what function I should define first. In doing so, I determined that _primes would be the best one to start with. 

I created a list called primelist and wrote nested for loops with if statements in each defining and checking the conditions of the number set. I then added the number(if it was a prime) to the list that I defined first and then returned that list. after _primes, I tackled _choice followed by _sample. _choice and _sample were simple enough. 

for _choice, I set a variable to a random character in the scope of 0 and the length of list a. Then, I treutned the rth value in the list a. 

For _sample, I began by writing a simple for loop that made a copy of the list a. I then had a second for loop that handled the shuffling and iteration of k values over b.

After _sample, I did the encrypt and decrypt functions. These were easy as I was just copying the command listed.

They keygen problem was a bit more difficult. I was able to sail smoothly through the picking of primes, calculating the p and q value as well as the m and n values. When I got to the while loop, I was unable to dertermine what I was doing wrong. I had realized that I was using a for loop and a while loop would be far more intuitive to go about. I then finished the problem without much difficulty at all.

      Issues and resolution: Just having some difficulty approaching the keygen problem, but after a while of brainstorming and sitting with my thoughts and I was able to come to a conclusion without too much grief. Other than that, I did not encounter any issues on this problem.

   Problem 2 (Keygen Program)
      Approach: I began by accepting lo and hi as integer command line arguments. I then created a variable with the name key that would do an rsa.keygen call for the values from lo to hi. I then wrote the values of keygen[0 - 3] as strings separated by spaces in order to create the key. 

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues when approaching this problem.

   Problem 3 (Encryption Program)
      Approach: I began by accepting n and e as command-line inputs. After that, I set the width to the bitlength by calling rsa.bitlength and setting message to a list reading all characters. I then turned "c" into integer and encrypted it. I then wrote the binary to decimal form of the encrypted value.  

      Issues and resolution: I did not encounter any issues when approaching this problem. 

   Problem 4 (Decryption Program)
      Approach: I began by accpeting n and d (integers) as command line arguments. I created a value width and et it equal to the bit length of n. I then set a variable with the name message to a list of all characters. I then wrote a for loop ranging from 0 to length of message - 1, incremented by width. I then set s equal to

      Issues and resolution: I had some trouble going about the decryption function action for about half an hour until I had realized that I had forgotten to return the actual decrypted variable and just had it set to calculate the actual variable. Once I had that sorted out, things were pretty okay, other than the fact that gradescope was all over the place for a bit.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   RSA is such an interesting topic to me, I really enjoy the concept and can directly see how this project will aid in my future career aspirations. This one was very fun to work through.
